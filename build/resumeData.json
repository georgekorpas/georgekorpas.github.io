Afterwards, I had short posts at Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon and at the National University of Singapore working on algebraic machine learning and aspects of topological quantum field theories and topological string theory. Currently I am a Research Fellow at the Optimization Group of the Department of Computer Science at the at the Czech Technical University in Prague. My work currently focuses on convex optimization methods for quantum computing and quantum information theory.",
